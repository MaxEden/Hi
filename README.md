# Hi!
Hi is a simple tcp/udp communication library for inter-process communication and local network communication.  
It consists out of udp discovery server/client and a tcp server/client.  
It's deliberately ascetic and supports only simple strings as messages and one-to-one communication.  
It's made for simple inter-process communication, mobile-to-desktop applications and IoT solutions.  
Text messages format implies trivial and streamlined debugging and is easily extensible with something like JSON.
